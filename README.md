# Planner-HMK
This is a planner.

It exists to help someone plan things.

The current hour will be displayed in red.
Past hours will be displayed in grey.
Future hours will be displayed in green.

Clearing all will delete everything from the planner and local storage.

Or you could just buy a planner instead of going through all this trouble.

Just a thought.
